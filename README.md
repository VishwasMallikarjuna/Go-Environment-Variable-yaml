Go-Environment-Variable-yaml
============================

To create a `config.yml` file for managing environment variables in a Go application, you can use a YAML format to define key-value pairs for different configuration parameters. Here's an example of how you can structure a `config.yml` file:

```yaml
# Example config.yml file
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  username: user
  password: password
  dbname: dbname
````
Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the config.yml with your actual configuration parameters. Also, ensure that you handle errors appropriately, such as when reading the file or unmarshaling YAML data.
