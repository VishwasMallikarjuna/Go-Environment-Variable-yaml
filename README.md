============================

To create a `config.yml` file for managing environment variables in a Go application, you can use a YAML format to define key-value pairs for different configuration parameters. Here's an example of how you can structure a `config.yml` file:

```yaml
# Example config.yml file
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  username: user
  password: password
  dbname: dbname
